Put these values into a new table.
Formatted the yearly change and percent change columns as follows:
  Yearly change rounds to 2 decimal places.
  Yearly change value is highlighted green for positive changes and red for negative changes.
  Percent change rounds to 2 decimals and has the percent symbol behind it.
